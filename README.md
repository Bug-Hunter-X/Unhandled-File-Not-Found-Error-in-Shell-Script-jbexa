This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: failure to handle the case where a file to be read does not exist.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to read a file that is unlikely to exist, resulting in a script failure.  The `bugSolution.sh` script provides a solution illustrating robust file handling.
